Louis is Wrong. The key difference here is the exchange process requires calculating a `difference` in addition to the processes of `deposit` and `withdrawal`. The difference process involves access to `balance` and it could be interleaved with other processes to produce wrong balances at the end.

In the `transfer` procedure, there's only `withdrawal` and `deposit` and both are protected (and access to `balance` is inside these protcted procedures) so they can't be interleaved.
