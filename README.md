My solutions to exercises from "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs". I'm following Berkeley's CS61A from 2011.

**Key Highlights:**

1. **Comprehensive Problem-Solving:**
   - The repository contains solutions to a wide range of problems spanning various chapters of SICP.
   - Each solution is meticulously crafted, demonstrating proficiency in algorithmic thinking and problem decomposition.

2. **Functional Programming Proficiency:**
   - SICP emphasizes functional programming principles, and my solutions showcase a solid grasp of concepts like first-class procedures, lexical scoping, and higher-order functions.

3. **Abstraction and Modularity:**
   - Solutions are designed with a focus on abstraction and modularity, adhering to the principles laid out in SICP.
   - Clear documentation accompanies each solution, providing insights into the thought process and design considerations.

4. **Algorithmic Complexity and Efficiency:**
   - Where applicable, attention is given to the efficiency of algorithms, demonstrating an understanding of time and space complexity.
