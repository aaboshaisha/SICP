10 -> X^2 -> 100 -> X^3 -> 1000000

And the other way around:

- X^2 READ X=10
- X^3 READ X=10 then RUN and SET 1000
- X^2 RUN X=100 then SET X=100

And the other way around so we get X=1000:

- (* x x) -> 2 accesses to X that can be interleaved
- (* x x x) -> 3 accesses to X that can be interleaved

- 10 10 -> 100
- 10 1000 -> 10000
- 1000 1000 -> 1000000
- 10 100 100 -> 100000
- 100 100 100 -> 1000000

With Serialization, the only possibility that remains is 1000000 (either 10^2 followed by ^3 or the other way around).
