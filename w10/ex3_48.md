Deadlock happens when we have 2 Procedures P1 and P2 trying to acquire serializers S1 and S2. 

```
(S1 (S2 P1))
(S2 (S1 P2))
```

1.  P1 gets S1.
2.  P2 gets S2.
3.  P1 wants S2, can't have it, waits.
4.  P2 wants S1, can't have it, waits.

This happens because they asked for the serializers in reverse order from one another. If they did it in the same order, the worst that could happen is one will have to wait longer.

Suppose we impose this ordering: 
```
(S1 (S2 P1))
(S1 (S2 P2))
```
One scenario might be:
1. P1 gets S2
2. P2 wants S2, can't have it, waits.
3. P1 gets S1
4. P1 releases both S1 and S2 after finishing
5. P2 gets S1
6. P2 gets S2
7. P2 finishes and releases both.
