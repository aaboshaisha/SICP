 Given a one-argument procedure p and an object a, p is said to “halt” on a if evaluating the expression (p a) returns a value (as opposed to terminating with an error message or running forever). Show that it is impossible to write a procedure halts? that correctly determines whether p halts on a for any procedure p and object a. Use the following reasoning: If you had such a procedure halts?, you could implement the following program:

```
(define (run-forever)
  (run-forever))

(define (try p)
  (if (halts? p p)
      (run-forever)
      'halted))
```
Now consider evaluating the expression `(try try)` and show that any possible outcome (either halting or running forever) violates the intended behavior of halts?


---Ans---
Now, consider `(try try)` and suppose that 

```
(try p) - try as arg
(try try) 
(if (halts? try try)
    (run-forever)
    ('halted)
```
(halts? try try) should either return 
- true : if halts
- false : if runs forever

- If `(halts? try try)` returns true, then try has supposedly halted. But this is the else condition which supposedly should have returned `halted`
- If `(halts? try try)` returns false, then try has supposedly run-forever (the if true conndition) and so we see contradiciton in both cases.
