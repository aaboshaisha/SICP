A function $f$ is defined as:

$f(n) = n$ if $n < 3$

$f(n) = f(n - 1) + 2f(n - 2) + 3f(n - 3)$ if $n >= 3$

Write a procedure that computes f by means of a recursive process. Write a procedure that computes f by means of an iterative process.

## Answer

The recursive procedure is very easy as it's just a direct translation of the math.

```
(define (rf n)
  (if (< n 3)
      n
      (+ (rf (- n 1))
         (* 2 (rf (- n 2)))
         (* 3 (rf (- n 3)))
         )))
```

To turn into an iterative procedure we have to recognize what are the intermediate variables of the computation that are produced at each step and how to transition from them to next state.

We observe that when n > 3:

```
f(3) = f(2) + 2f(1) + 3f(0)
f(4) = f(3) + 2f(2) + 3f(1)
f(5) = f(4) + 2f(3) + 3f(2)
...
```

if we let `f(n) = r = a + 2b + 3c`, then we can see that at each step:

```
r -> new a
a -> new b
b -> new c
```
So we can call f at each step on 

```
r (new a) = a + 2b + 3c
b = a
c = b
```

as follows:

```
#lang racket
(define (f a b c n)
  (if (< n 3)
      a
      (f (+ a (* 2 b) (* 3 c)) a b (- n 1))))

(define (iter-f n)
  (if (< n 3)
      n
      (f 2 1 0 n)))
```
