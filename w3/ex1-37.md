Ex1.37 Gives the definition of infinite continued fraction as:
$$f = \frac{N_1}{D_1 + \frac{N_2}{D_2 + \frac{N_3}{D_3 + \frac{N_4}{D_4 + \ldots}}}$$

Suppose that n and d are procedures of one argument (the term index 
i) that return the $N_i$ and $D_i$
 of the terms of the continued fraction. Define a procedure `cont-frac` such that evaluating `(cont-frac n d k)` computes the value of the k-term finite continued fraction. Check your procedure by approximating 
1/Ï† using:

```
(cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
           (lambda (i) 1.0)
           k)
```

Do it with recursive process and iterative process.

## Answer

We start with a recursive definition (since this is usually easier as in many cases it's a direct translation  of the math). The key is to recognize that: if $a_i$ is the $i^{th}$ fraction, we can define the function as:

$$ a_0 = 1$$

$$ a_i = \frac{n_i}{d_i + a_{i-1}}$$ where $i >= 1$

Which makes for a straightforward recursive implementation:

```
(define (cont-frac n d k)
  (if (= k 0)
      1.0
      (/ (n k)
         (+ (d k) (cont-frac n d (- k 1))  ))
      )) 



(cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
           (lambda (i) 1.0)
           10)
```

And to make this into an iterative implementation, we have to add a cumulative sum (state variable) which stores the results of each $a_i$ computation to use in the next step. This sum starts at 0 and is returned once we're dpone.

```
; iterative version
(define (iter-frac n d k sum)
  (if (= k 0)
      sum
      (iter-frac n d (- k 1) (/ (n k) (+ (d k) sum)))))


(iter-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
           (lambda (i) 1.0)
           10 0)
```
