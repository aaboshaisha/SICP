We know the first element of S is 1, and the stream-cdr is the result
of adding S and S, so we get:

```
  1 ...
+ 1 ...
--------
  2 ...
```

So the second element must be 2. That means we have:

```
  1 2 ...
+ 1 2 ...
----------
  2 4 ...
```

So the third element is 4, and 4th is 8 and so on
```
