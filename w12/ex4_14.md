underlying-scheme and machine language will be used interchangeably

Recall what `map` looks like:
`(map f args)`

- `map` takes a procedure (written in scheme) as first arg.
- If we implement `map` in underlying-scheme (machine language) then it expects machine language `f` as argument. What it gets instead is `f` written in Scheme code so it is text to it.
