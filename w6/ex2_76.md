Conventional style: 
- to add new types we need to add their functions
- to add new operations, we need to change the code for each type
- we change pre-existing code

DDP:
- to add new types, we need to add a row (all their procedures)
- to add new operations, we need to add a column (procedure for each type)
- we don't change pre-existing code

Message Passing:
- to add new types, we implement all their procedures
- to add new operations, we add new code to existing code / change it
