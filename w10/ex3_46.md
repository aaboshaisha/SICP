Suppose we have mutex [F] and processes P1 and P2 trying to acquire it.

An exmple of a fail case is:P1 access P2 access P1 set P2 set

- P1 -> access -> [F] -> set to [T] -> release [F]
- P2 -> access -> [F] ---------------> set to [T] -> release [F]

P1 starts doing (if (car cell) ...) and gets the value FALSE,
so it thinks the mutex is free.

Now P2 runs, before P1 does anything else.  It, too, does
(if (car cell) ...), reads the value FALSE, and thinks the
mutex is free.

Then they both set the value to TRUE and claim the mutex.

We have to make sure that there is no intervening process between
reading (car cell) and (set-car! cell true).
